# Refactoring Ruby Edition

*I have read this book twice, but I still learning something new from the book every time I read it.*  

This time I do it differently as well. I will work through examples step by step with separate commit and by chapter.

#### [Chapter 1: Refactoring, a First Example](https://github.com/samnang/refactoring-ruby-edition/commits/chapter_01)
#### [Chapter 6: Composing Methods](https://github.com/samnang/refactoring-ruby-edition/commits/chapter_06)
* [Extract Method](https://github.com/samnang/refactoring-ruby-edition/tree/chapter_06/chapter_06/extract_method)
* [Inline Method](https://github.com/samnang/refactoring-ruby-edition/tree/chapter_06/chapter_06/inline_method)
